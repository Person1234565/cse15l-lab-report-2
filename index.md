# Servers and Bugs  
## Part 1: StringServer   
This is my code for StringServer:

This is the page that pops up when I run StringServer with different queries:  
  
After /add-message?s=Hello:

After /add-message?s=World:

## Part 2: Bugs  

## Part 3: Reflection  
  
I learned about how servers handle queries as well as the components of a URI. I also learned about various testing concepts such as the definitions of symptoms vs. bugs. I never conceptualized the difference between the two terms and how the same symptom might be caused by multiple bugs or how one bug can cause multiple symptoms.
